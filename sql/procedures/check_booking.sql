-- Task 2
-- For your second task, Little Lemon need you to create a stored procedure called CheckBooking
-- to check whether a table in the restaurant is already booked.
-- Creating this procedure helps to minimize the effort involved in repeatedly coding the same SQL statements.

-- The procedure should have two input parameters in the form of booking date and table number.
-- You can also create a variable in the procedure to check the status of each table.

	ELSE
